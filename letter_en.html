        OPEN LETTER TO BEN WEYTS,<br/>
        THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION,<br/>
        RECTORS OF UNIVERSITIES AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IN BELGIUM

    <p>
      As Russian citizens living, studying, and working in Belgium, we express our grave concern over a growing trend of exclusion of Russian students from education and scholarship programs in the European Union.
      As such, Russian students have already been excluded from the Flemish <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/belgium-s-flanders-region-suspends-study-grants-for-russians-report/2527870">Mastermind</a> scholarship program.
    </p>

    <p>
    We do understand the tragic necessity of most sanctions imposed on Russia by the international community. <b>We stand in solidarity with Ukraine and condemn the actions of the Russian government.</b> Each of us is determined to support and help Ukrainian people in their fight for home, and we welcome any help offered to Ukrainians by Belgian universities.
    </p>

    <p>
However, we strongly believe that depriving Russian students of higher-education programs in Europe is counterproductive and serves no good. The students are one of the most politically active groups in Russia who oppose the Kremlin oppressive regime. Many of them are facing expulsion from universities for expressing their anti-war and civil position.
    </p>

    <p>
    For instance, four journalists from a student magazine <a href="https://news.doxajournal.ru/novosti/studenty-zapustili-peticiyu-protiv-otchisleniya-iz-spbgu-za-uchastie-v-protestah/">DOXA</a> have spent a year under house arrest for a video encouraging other students to be brave and stand up for their rights. Since February 24 more than <a href="https://ovdinfo.org/">14,000</a> people have been detained in Russia for anti-war demonstrations. Many of them are students and youth. There have already been <a href="https://www.severreal.org/a/v-peterburge-iz-spbgu-otchislyat-uchastvovavshih-v-antivoennyh-mitingah-studentov/31738584.html">cases of expulsions</a> of such students from Russian universities, and we expect such cases to grow. For these students, studying in Europe might be the only opportunity to get higher education and to avoid being conscripted into the army.
    </p>

    <p>
By welcoming Russian students to study in Belgium, you also give them the chance to experience life in a democratic society. These young people will absorb European values and bring them home once they return to build a new democratic Russia.
    </p>

    <p>
    We would like to draw your attention to the fact that we are not alone in thinking that students and youth from Russia should not bear the burden of the war crimes committed by the Russian government. Luc Sels – rector of the leading Flemish university KULeuven – <a href="https://twitter.com/LucSels/status/1501170204998606852">expressed a similar sentiment</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
We urge Belgian scientific society to prevent any discriminative measures against those Russian students who stand for democracy and peace and believe in European values of justice and human rights. We ask to reconsider the already taken decisions that deprive Russian students of the opportunity for higher education, without the fear of being repressed for anti-war views.
