    This is a street art created by the Belgian activists from the <a href="https://russiansolidarity.be">Russian Solidarity</a> movement aiming at bringing public attention to nowadays issues in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. The mural gathers the portraits of nine women, who are well-known activists, journalists and artists. As a consequence of their pro-democratic and liberal views, they became victims of the autocratic regimes. Ukrainians and Russians paid with their lives, Beloarussians found themselves imprisoned. How many others should suffer or die from this regime? In the memory of brave.
